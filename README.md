## Development and execution

This project requires at least **Python version 3.7** (game was made in  Python ver. 3.9) and must use **Arcade ver. 2.6.17**.
Arcade version might not be installed when the assets are downloaded so you may install it manually after forking and cloning with the following steps:
- Go to File, Settings (or just do CTRL + Comma) and click the option where your project name is displayed.
- Select 'Python Interpreter'.
- Click the '+' button and search for Arcade library.
- Select the aforementioned library and check the 'Specify other version' box.
- Select ver. 2.6.17 and press 'Install'.
- Wait until it's done and press 'Close'.
- Go to 'rpg' folder, click 'main' (between double underscores) and execute the file.
- If it doesn't work, please refer to the next section.
