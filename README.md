##  <u>Gameplay.</u>
This is where we are supposed to explain how the game works and tell about its mechanics.

## <u>Controls.</u>
- **Movement:** WASD / Arrow Keys
- **Power-up mode / Helmet selector** 1-4 *(Number keys, not NumPad)*:<br>
-> Mode 1: Standard mode: does nothing, makes the player move normally.<br>
-> Mode 2: Dash mode [SPACEBAR]: allows the player to dash and leap / go through objects.<br>
-> Mode 3: Sprint mode [Hold LSHIFT]: allows the player to sprint and move faster than usual.<br>
-> Mode 4: Ram mode [SPACEBAR]: similarly to dash mode, but slower and further.
- **Open Menu:** ESC

## <u>Development and execution.</u>

This project requires <u>**at least Python version 3.7**</u> (game was made in  Python ver. 3.9) and must use <u>**Arcade ver. 2.6.17**</u>.
Arcade version might not be installed when the assets are downloaded so you may install it manually after forking and cloning with the following steps:
- Go to File, Settings (or just do CTRL + Comma) and click the option where your project name is displayed.
- Select 'Python Interpreter'.
- Click the '+' button and search for Arcade library.
- Select the aforementioned library and check the 'Specify other version' box.
- Select ver. 2.6.17 and press 'Install'.
- Wait until it's done and press 'Close'.
- Go to 'rpg' folder, click 'main' (between double underscores) and execute the file.
- If it doesn't work, please refer to the next section.
